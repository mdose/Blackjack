Blackjack
=========

Basic Rules
-----------

* One dealer and one player
* Use 52 cards (one deck)
* Dealer deals two cards to player and to self (alternating with player dealt first)
* After the deal, check to see if player has winning conditions
* Winning Conditions:
  * Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a "blackjack" or a "natural"), without a dealer blackjack
  * Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21
  * Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21
* If the player exceeds 21 they bust and the dealer wins
* The dealer must hit until the cards total 17 or more points
* If both player and dealer have the same total, this is called a "push" and the player does not win

MVP Work Flow

  1. Shuffle 52 cards
  2. Dealer deals player first card, then deals card to self
  3. Dealer deals player second card, then deals second card to self

  8. Check to see if the player busts, if so dealer wins
  9. Check to see if player has 21, if so stand

  11. Dealer plays
  12. Dealer must hit continuously if under 17
  13. When dealer stands or busts, the game ends
